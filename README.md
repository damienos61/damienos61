## About

I am a systems-oriented software developer with a strong focus on  
low-level engineering, secure architectures, and performance-driven design.

I work close to the machine and prefer explicit, understandable systems over opaque abstractions.  
Most of my work revolves around building robust foundations: data pipelines, core libraries, communication layers, and security primitives.

I value software that is predictable, inspectable, and resilient under constraints.

## Areas of Focus

### Systems Engineering
- Deterministic and reactive architectures  
- Explicit state management and data flow control  
- Low-level abstractions designed for clarity and longevity  

### Security and Reliability
- Integrity-first system design  
- Cryptographic primitives and secure workflows  
- Auditability, traceability, and failure visibility  

### Performance and Efficiency
- CPU and memory-aware implementations  
- Hybrid high-level and low-level designs  
- Optimization guided by real constraints rather than assumptions  

### Exploration
- Protocol design and alternative models  
- Non-standard synchronization strategies  
- Experimental system concepts and tooling

## Approach

I approach software design with a strong emphasis on fundamentals.

I favor simple primitives, explicit contracts, and systems that can be reasoned about without hidden behavior.  
Abstractions are useful, but only when they are justified, measurable, and transparent.

If a tool hides too much complexity, I usually prefer to understand and rebuild the core myself.
